# WeChat Project For Humanise.ai

# What Activities does it support?

Currently, this project does not support buch of the stuff because of some WeChat limitations. So, things it supports:
Activities: MessageActivity and TypingActivity
Attachments: ButtonCardAttachment, HeroCardAttachment and MediaAttachment.
QuickReply Buttons: MessageBackAction, OpenURLAction, DownloadFileAction, ShowImageFileAction, ActivitySignInAction, ActivityCallAction. Note: quick reply just sends back the content (message or url) of these actions, except for ShowImageFileActions. For this action it sends downloaded image to the user.
