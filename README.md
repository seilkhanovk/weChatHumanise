# WeChat Project For Humanise.ai

## What Activities does it support?

Currently, this project does not support buch of the stuff because of some WeChat limitations. So, things it supports: <br/>
**Activities**: MessageActivity and TypingActivity <br/>
**Attachments**: ButtonCardAttachment, HeroCardAttachment and MediaAttachment. <br/>
**QuickReply Buttons**: MessageBackAction, OpenURLAction, DownloadFileAction, ShowImageFileAction, ActivitySignInAction, ActivityCallAction. Note: quick reply just sends back the content (message or url) of these actions, except for ShowImageFileActions. For this action it sends downloaded image to the user.
